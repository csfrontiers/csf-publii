Its visual notation is based on Scratch from MIT and uses the open source JavaScript code base of Snap! from Berkeley. Both of these are extremely successful tools in K12 computer science education. NetsBlox adds the capability of networking and enables distributed programming at a level accessible to young learners. This helps teach 21st century skills and makes programming more engaging.</p>\n<p>NetsBlox also enables programs running on separate computers to talk to each other. Hence, students can write multi-player games such as Tic Tac Toe or Battleship and other truly distributed programs. NetsBlox supports collaborative program editing similar to how Google Docs work. This opens up new ways of project-based learning, new ways of teaching, as well as enables pair programming even when students are not sitting at the same table. Unlimited undo/redo is also supported.</p>\n<p>NetsBlox opens up the internet with its vast array of public domain scientific and other data sources making it possible to create STEM projects such as displaying seismic activity anywhere on Earth using an interactive Google Maps background. Similarly, weather, air pollution, and many other data sources such as the Open Movie Database and the Sloan Digital Sky Server are available. We are adding new services on a regular basis. The same facility can help implement more complicated multi-player games by providing server-side support.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><a href=\"https://netsblox.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/netsblox-home.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"475\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/netsblox-home-xs.png 384w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/netsblox-home-sm.png 600w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/netsblox-home-md.png 768w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/netsblox-home-lg.png 1200w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/netsblox-home-xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1gnmbil0h1f5\">NetsBlox Editor</h3>\n<p>If you prefer a more hands-on learning experience, there is plenty of information built into the <a href=\"https://editor.netsblox.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NetsBlox editor</a> to introduce you to some of the new features it has added to Snap!

Once connected, a NetsBlox service of the same name can be used to communicate back and forth between the mobile device and a student's NetsBlox project running in the browser. The PhoneIoT service allows access to many of the device's sensors (e.g., accelerometer, orientation, location, camera), as well as the ability to customize the app's display with interactive components such as buttons, image displays, joysticks, and more, all from within NetsBlox. PhoneIoT uses the same RPC and message passing paradigms used by other NetsBlox services, making PhoneIoT relatively easy to pick up for students who are already familiar with NetsBlox.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/phoneiot-play-store.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"396\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/phoneiot-play-store-xs.png 384w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/phoneiot-play-store-sm.png 600w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/phoneiot-play-store-md.png 768w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/phoneiot-play-store-lg.png 1200w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/4/responsive/phoneiot-play-store-xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1gnmbil0h1f7\">Getting Started with PhoneIoT</h3>\n<p>To get started, simply install the PhoneIoT app on your mobile device, which is available free of charge through the App Store (iOS) or Google Play store (Android). Once installed, launch the app; you should see an open menu on the left side of the screen. Notably, near the top of the menu, there is an area that shows your device id and password (default zero), which will be needed to connect to the device from a NetsBlox project. To connect the device to the NetsBlox server, simple press the <strong>Connect</strong> button (all defaults are acceptable).</p>\n<p>Once in a NetsBlox project, you can use <strong>call</strong> or <strong>run</strong> blocks with the PhoneIoT service (first dropdown) to invoke any number of RPCs (remote procedure calls) (second dropdown) to communicate with the device. Most PhoneIoT RPCs require a device id, which you can get from the app's menu. However, before you can access the phone, you need to run a special RPC called <a href=\"https://editor.netsblox.org/docs/services/PhoneIoT/index.html#PhoneIoT.setCredentials\">PhoneIoT.setCredentials</a>, which is where you enter your device password (shown in the app menu). The <a href=\"https://editor.netsblox.org/docs/services/PhoneIoT/index.html\">PhoneIoT documentation</a> has more detailed information on general usage and specific RPCs that you might want to use.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/demos.html\">Demos</a> for some example videos using PhoneIoT!</p>",

Creating pathways that stimulate high school learners' interest in advanced topics with the goal of building a diverse, gender-balanced, future-ready workforce is a crucial and impactful imperative addressed in this work. An experienced multi-disciplinary team of researchers, high school teachers, and industry partners will be involved in the design of a new, modular, open-access curriculum called Computer Science Frontiers (CSF) that provides an engaging introduction to these advanced topics in high school (that are currently accessible only to CS majors in college). To address the dire gender disparity in computing, the project will design and research the curriculum to engage female students. Through studying the impact of innovative computing tools and curricular units on learning, attitudes, interests, and collaboration of students (and especially young women), the project will advance discovery and understanding to aid the cause of broadening participation in technology-related careers as well as the future of work at the human-technology frontier. The open access modular design of the curricular materials and the dissemination activities will ensure wide adoption of the products of this research.</p>\n<p>The project leverages <a href=\"https://netsblox.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NetsBlox</a>, a powerful yet easy-to-use visual programming environment that has been shown to increase engagement and interest in computing. Additionally, NetsBlox supports effective collaboration while facilitating learning of distributed computing, networking, and cybersecurity in informal settings. Early phases of the project will involve design and refinement of curricular modules through co-design workshops with seven participating teachers, summer camps with students, and pilot implementations in Tennessee and North Carolina, leading to full classroom implementations in Year 3 by the high school teachers. Data collected through surveys, student portfolios, teacher interviews, and digital logs from NetsBlox will be analyzed. Research findings will help in understanding if and how advanced computing methods alongside key competencies can be introduced in high school; how pedagogies involving project-based activities around real-world, multidisciplinary problems work to increase female students' interests in computing; and which advanced topics work better than others in terms of difficulty level and engagement.</p>\n<p>This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program of the National Science Foundation, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.</p>\n<h2>Affiliates</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.ncsu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 256px;\" src=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/nc-state-banner-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"251\" height=\"41\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nc-state-banner-2-xs.jpeg 384w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nc-state-banner-2-sm.jpeg 600w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nc-state-banner-2-md.jpeg 768w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nc-state-banner-2-lg.jpeg 1200w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nc-state-banner-2-xl.jpeg 1600w\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-radius: 256px;\" src=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/vandy-banner.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"364\" height=\"42\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/vandy-banner-xs.jpeg 384w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/vandy-banner-sm.jpeg 600w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/vandy-banner-md.jpeg 768w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/vandy-banner-lg.jpeg 1200w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/vandy-banner-xl.jpeg 1600w\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/looking-glass-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"192\" height=\"59\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/looking-glass-logo-xs.png 384w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/looking-glass-logo-sm.png 600w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/looking-glass-logo-md.png 768w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/looking-glass-logo-lg.png 1200w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/looking-glass-logo-xl.png 1600w\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/nsf-logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"113\" height=\"114\" sizes=\"(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw\" srcset=\"https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nsf-logo-xs.png 384w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nsf-logo-sm.png 600w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nsf-logo-md.png 768w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nsf-logo-lg.png 1200w ,https://csfrontiers.github.io/csf-publii/media/posts/1/responsive/nsf-logo-xl.png 1600w\"></a></p>",
